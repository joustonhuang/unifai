# UnifAI

**A governed agentic AI operating system.**

**Run your own AI society -- locally.**

UnifAI is built on the **UnifAI Protocol** — a governance-first architecture for multi-agent AI systems.

UnifAI explores a structured approach to building AI societies where multiple agents, tools, and models collaborate under a clear governance layer.


The system was co-designed by Jouston Huang <jouston@linux.com> with assistance from Lyra, a cloud-based advanced LLM used for high-level reasoning.

# Philosophy

Most AI agent systems start with models and tools.

UnifAI starts with **governance**.

The project aims to build a governed, agentic AI operating system in which AI agents, humans, and external models operate within a structured constitutional framework.

```

governance
→ policy
→ agents
→ models

```

The goal is to prevent uncontrolled agent behavior and build systems that remain **auditable, predictable, and controllable**.

---

# Lyra–Little7 Constitution (v0.1)

The UnifAI runtime follows a minimal governance framework.

## Core Principle

**Supervisor is the single authority of the system.**

All agents, models, tools, and external services must interact through the Supervisor.

The Supervisor must remain:

- minimal
- auditable
- human-understandable

---

# Rule 0 — Secret Sovereignty

Secrets **never leave the Supervisor**.

Examples:

- LLM API keys
- messaging gateways
- system credentials
- external service tokens

Agents never directly access secrets.  
Supervisor executes requests on their behalf.

---

# Rule 1 — Task Routing Authority

All tasks must first be triaged by **Keyman**.

```

Agent request
↓
Supervisor
↓
Keyman (local LLM triage)
↓
easy / complex

```

Keyman only performs **task difficulty classification and routing**.

---

# Rule 2 — Local Execution (JohnDoe)

Simple tasks are executed by **JohnDoe**, a local LLM worker.

Characteristics:

- runs locally
- no secret access
- no external API calls

Typical workload:

- local reasoning
- shell automation
- data processing
- routine system tasks

JohnDoe may be replaced as hardware evolves.

---

# Rule 3 — External Oracle Invocation

Complex tasks require external reasoning.

```

complex task
↓
Oracle request
↓
Supervisor injects API key
↓
Lyra reasoning

```

**Lyra (Cloud-based Advanced LLM)** performs high-level reasoning.

Important constraints:

- Oracle never sees API keys
- Oracle only receives Supervisor-returned results

---

# Rule 4 — System Guardian (Neo)

**Neo monitors system integrity.**

Signals monitored:

1. abnormal task failure rate
2. excessive token or API usage
3. high-risk behaviors

Examples:

- prompt injection attempts
- secret probing
- attempts to modify Supervisor
- memory manipulation

Escalation path:

```

Neo → Supervisor → Lyra consultation

```

Neo may recommend:

- pausing agents
- launching investigation
- system degradation mode

---

# Rule 5 — Kill Switch Authority

Supervisor must support **Kill Switch mechanisms**.

Capabilities:

- stop individual agents
- revoke API access
- terminate runaway loops
- no system restart required

Triggers may come from:

- Architect (Human)
- Neo
- Lyra (advisory)
- Supervisor policy

---

# Rule 6 — Budget Governance (Bill)

**Bill manages model budgets.**

Future UnifAI systems may interact with multiple generative AI services:

- GPT 5.2 or above
- Gemini 3.x or above
- Grok
- Claude
- MidJourney
- Gamma
- Canva
- future models

Bill responsibilities:

- token budget planning
- API call rate control
- resource allocation across models
- cost optimization

Bill does **not hold API keys**.

---

# Rule 7 — Human Communication Gateway

All communication with the **Architect (Human)** must pass through the Supervisor.

Potential interfaces include:

- Telegram
- WhatsApp
- Email
- future control channels

Agents cannot directly contact humans.

```

Agent → Supervisor → notify_human()

```

---

# Rule 8 — Human Reporting (Mr. Wilson)

**Wilson is the human reporting agent.**

Role:

Reporter / Summarizer / Communication broker

Responsibilities:

- aggregate agent results
- produce human-readable summaries
- filter noise

Wilson has:

- no secret access
- no API access
- no direct communication ability

Only the Supervisor sends messages.

---

# Rule 9 — Spec & Question Ledger

To prevent agents from guessing requirements, the system maintains two ledgers.

### Specs Ledger

Stores confirmed specifications:

- scope
- constraints
- acceptance criteria
- version

---

### Questions Ledger

Unclear requirements are converted into structured questions.

```

question → Architect
answer → Specs Ledger

```

Agents read **Specs Ledger only**.

---

# Rule 10 — Dual Mode Human Interface

Two reporting modes are supported.

## Debug Mode

Output:

A + B

A: engineering detail

- task_id
- agent
- token usage
- tool calls
- stderr

B: human-readable summary

---

## Normal Mode

Output:

B only

Human-focused summaries with noise removed.

---

# System Architecture (Simplified)

```
            Architect
                 ↑
         Supervisor Gateway
                 ↑

                 ↑
  ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐

```

JohnDoe                       Oracle

```
    ↑                       ↑
    └──────── Keyman ───────┘
       (Task Routing)
```

Neo  → Monitoring
Bill → Budget Control

Lyra → Cloud-based Advanced LLM

```

# Final Principle

Agents are tools.  
Supervisor is governance.  
Architect is sovereignty.

No agent may bypass governance.

---

# Project Status

Early experimental architecture.

The goal is to explore **governed multi-agent AI systems** that can run even on modest hardware.

Reference node: **Little7**.
