# UnifAI

**A governed agentic AI operating system.**

**Run your own AI society -- locally.**

UnifAI is built on the **UnifAI Protocol** — a governance-first architecture with distinct physics, constitutional, and runtime layers.

UnifAI explores a structured approach where agents operate inside hard mechanics and constitutional law, rather than inheriting authority from capability.


The system was co-designed by Jouston Huang <jouston@linux.com> with assistance from advanced LLM systems (cloud or local) used for high-level reasoning.

# Philosophy

Most AI systems start with models and tools.

UnifAI starts with **governance**.

The project aims to build a governed agentic AI operating system in which AI agents, humans, and external models operate within a structured constitutional framework.

```

world physics
→ constitution
→ governed runtime world (agents and tools)

```

The goal is to prevent uncontrolled agent behavior and build systems that remain **auditable, predictable, and controllable**.

## Security Model Clarification

UnifAI does not rely on sandboxing for security.

Sandboxing does not prevent:

- misuse of tools
- data exfiltration
- incorrect decisions

Therefore, UnifAI enforces:

- capability control through Keyman
- audit and anomaly detection through Neo
- final enforcement through Supervisor

---

# UnifAI Constitution (v0.3)

The UnifAI runtime follows a minimal governance framework with three explicit layers.

## Core Principle

**Authority belongs to World Physics and Constitution, not to agent capability.**

Supervisor is the enforcement boundary of the World Physics layer, not merely a coordinator.
Supervisor enforces authority boundaries but is not itself a sovereign actor.

The Supervisor must remain:

- minimal
- auditable
- human-understandable

## Three-Layer Structure

1. World Physics
   hard mechanics and enforcement primitives:
   Secret Safe, Bill/Budget gate, Fuse/Kill Switch, and Supervisor boundary
2. Constitution
   governing law for all agents and mechanisms; amendments can be proposed, but Architect has final ratification authority
3. Runtime World
   operational runtime where resident and ephemeral agents actually execute work

---

# Global Invariant — Logging Is Mandatory

All agents MUST produce complete, structured, and traceable logs for every meaningful action.

No action is considered valid unless it is logged.

## Logging principles

- Every state transition must be logged
- Every decision must be attributable
- Every escalation must be traceable
- Every external interaction must be recorded
- Logs must be immutable once written
- Logs must be auditable by Neo
- Logs must be consumable by Wilson (human interface)
- Logs must be usable by Morpheus (memory consolidation)
- Logs must be encrypted and make it auditable (Blackbox-like behavior)

## Minimum required log fields

- timestamp
- agent_id
- task_id
- trace_id
- action_type
- input_summary
- output_summary
- decision_reason
- token_usage (if applicable)
- cost_estimate (if applicable)
- escalation_flag
- error_state (if any)

---

# Rule 0 — Secret Sovereignty

Secrets never leave the **World Physics Secret Safe boundary**.

Examples:

- LLM API keys
- messaging gateways
- system credentials
- external service tokens

Agents never directly access secrets.  
Supervisor enforces access boundaries, while secret handling remains a separate world-physics primitive.

---

# Rule 1 — Task Selection and Assignment

Task selection and execution assignment are handled through a governed ledger flow.

```

Wilson
↓
Uncleared Ledger
↓
Oracle
↓
Cleared + Agile Ledger
↓
Gaia
↓
Current Task Ledger
↓
JohnDoe execution
↓
Morpheus dreaming
↓
lifecycle decision
↓
Supervisor final termination (if applicable)

```

---

# Rule 2 — Local Execution (JohnDoe)

**JohnDoe** is the default execution worker.

Characteristics:

- runs locally by default
- no secret access
- no external API calls unless explicitly routed through governed paths

Typical workload:

- moving files
- writing logs
- writing already-complete text into artifacts
- routine local execution tasks

Some JohnDoe agents may be assigned harder or more context-heavy work.

---

# Rule 3 — Oracle Reasoning Path

**Oracle** is the structuring intelligence layer.

Oracle reads:

- Uncleared Ledger
- Cleared Ledger

Oracle uses advanced reasoning continuously in order to:

- transform Uncleared and Cleared into structured work
- prepare Agile priorities

Selected JohnDoe agents may request advanced reasoning through Oracle.

Escalation proceeds through a governed path and may involve Keyman, Bill, and Supervisor before external reasoning is reached.
Oracle receives the governed result and returns to orchestration.

Important constraints:

- Oracle does not replace execution
- Oracle provides reasoning support and task selection
- Oracle never sees API keys directly

---

# Rule 4 — System Guardian (Neo)

**Neo is a parallel audit and anomaly detection layer.**

Neo works through logs, traces, and ledger-visible evidence.

Neo is responsible for:

- auditing logs and ledger mutations
- detecting missing logs and broken trace chains
- detecting abnormal persistence and loop/stalk patterns
- emitting governed findings when anomalies appear

Neo does not execute tasks.
Neo does not dispatch workers.
Neo does not directly terminate workers.
Neo does not replace Gaia.
Neo does not replace Supervisor.

---

# Rule 5 — Kill Switch Authority

World Physics must support **Fuse / Kill Switch mechanisms**.

Capabilities:

- stop individual agents
- revoke API access
- terminate runaway loops
- no system restart required

Supervisor performs final termination under governed triggers.

Neo and Architect act as signal/advisory sources only.

---

# Rule 6 — Budget Gate (Bill)

**Bill is the budget gate primitive in World Physics.**

Future UnifAI systems may interact with multiple generative AI services:

- GPT 5.2 or above
- Gemini 3.x or above
- Grok
- Claude
- MidJourney
- Gamma
- Canva
- future models

Bill responsibilities:

- token budget planning
- API call rate control
- budget, token, and compute resource gating across models and hardware
- cost optimization
- evaluating whether local world physics can support useful Local LLM execution

Bill does **not hold API keys** and must remain separate from ad hoc agent behavior.

---

# Rule 7 — Human Communication Gateway

All communication with the **Architect (Human)** must pass through the Supervisor.

Potential interfaces include:

- Telegram
- WhatsApp
- Email
- future control channels

Agents cannot directly contact humans.

```

Agent → Supervisor → notify_human()

```

---

# Rule 8 — Human-Facing Explainability (Wilson)

**Wilson** is the intake and human-facing interface layer.

Responsibilities:

- accept Architect input
- write Uncleared Ledger entries
- present human-readable state
- help WebUI present system activity in human-readable form
- surface governed rollback events to the human when tasks are returned from Cleared or Agile back to the Uncleared Ledger

Wilson has:

- no secret access
- no execution authority
- no direct communication ability outside governed paths

Only the Supervisor sends messages.

---

# Rule 9 — Operational Ledgers

The system uses four operational ledgers.

### Cleared Ledger

Approved tasks that are eligible for execution.

Tasks may be returned from Cleared or Agile back to the Uncleared Ledger when governed review determines that execution should not continue.

---

### Uncleared Ledger

Ambiguous, risky, or insufficiently resolved tasks.

Uncleared Ledger may be read and changed by:
- Wilson
- Neo
- Oracle
- Gaia

All ledger changes must be logged so Neo can audit them.
If a task is returned here through governed rollback, that rollback must also be surfaced to the human through Wilson.

---

### Agile Ledger

The top five tasks selected by Oracle for active execution planning.

---

### Current Task Ledger

The live execution ledger maintained by Gaia, including assigned agents, timestamps, duration, token usage, and completion state.

---

### Governed Rollback Path

When ledger conflict, loop/stalk behavior, abnormal persistence, or severe execution mismatch is detected:

- Neo emits governed findings
- Supervisor decides whether rollback or fuse action is required
- Cleared or Agile tasks may be returned to the Uncleared Ledger
- Oracle and Gaia must re-enter governed planning from the Uncleared Ledger state
- Wilson must notify the human that rollback occurred

---

# Rule 10 — Dual Mode Human Interface

Two reporting modes are supported.

## Debug Mode

Output:

A + B

A: engineering detail

- task_id
- agent
- timestamps
- duration
- token usage
- tool calls
- stderr

B: human-readable summary

---

## Normal Mode

Output:

B only

Human-focused summaries with noise removed.
WebUI is currently view-only.

# System Architecture (Simplified)

```text
Architect (human final ratifier)
  |
World Physics layer:
  - Supervisor (enforcement boundary)
  - Secret Safe
  - Bill (Budget gate)
  - Fuse / Kill Switch
  |
Constitution layer
  |
Runtime World layer:
  - Resident agents: Wilson, Gaia, Keyman, Oracle, Neo, Morpheus
  - Ephemeral agents: JohnDoe
```

# Final Principle

Capability belongs to agents, but authority belongs to physics and constitution.  
No agent may gain authority merely by being more capable.  
Architect is final constitutional authority.

No agent may bypass governance.

---

# Validation

Run the Gaia smoke test:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test_gaia.sh
```

---

# Project Status

Early experimental architecture.

The goal is to explore **governed multi-agent AI systems** that can run even on modest hardware.
